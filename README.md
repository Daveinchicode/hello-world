# hello-world

Hello people,

I am new to CS and exploring opportunities to advance my career. I am hoping to fight my way from the bottom and get out of my current career in public accounting. I have a long way to go but excited to get started. Feel free to lend your support and donations (ha!)

Thanks,

David
